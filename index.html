         <li>Stop <span class="important">immediately</span> if you feel pain or anything more than discomfort from lack of stamina!</li>
         <li>It is preffered that you warm up your hands outside of a play warm up. This will help to strengthen your fingers as well as prevent injury. (Try <a href="https://youtu.be/H6y0D_8kRoU">this video</a>.</li>
         <li>Read and follow 1 step at a time. Don't skip over or start playing without reading the whole phase.</li>

           <p>This course will guide you how to stream faster and gain more stamina. This course is for somewhat advanced players who can do basic bursts and short streams.</p>
           <p>Remember this is how I [khz and sort of me] did it and this is one way to approach streams. I just found this the most efficient and simplest way for myself. Also this sheet is strongly focused on stamina, speed, finger control and accuracy. <span class="important">If you want to practice flow aim or pretty much any other streaming skill this is not the sheet for you.</span></p>
           <p>First of all download this if you haven't already:

         <h3 class="step__heading">PHASE 1</h3>
         <h4 class="step__sub-heading">Basic Finger Control for Streams</h4>
         <div class="step__text">
           <p>The first thing you want to do is to build some finger control for long streams because stream stamina is mostly technique and finger control.</p>
           <p>Start by playing Long Stream Practice Maps at 140bpm. There is a good chance you will need no fail in the beginning to even pass it. If that's the case just play it with no fail and do your best.</p>
           <p>You play this map 3 times when you start your osu! session and 3 times when you end it. Eventually you will get a 95%+ FC. This can take months or a couple days depending on how good you already are.</p>
           <p>If you reach a 95%+ FC you can move on and go 10bpm up. So you now play 150bpm 3 times when you start osu and 3 times before you close it until you reach your goal of a 95%+ fc.</p>
           <p>Continue doing this until you <strong>fc'd all diff's from 140bpm to 160bpm.</strong> Move on to phase 2 when you succeed.</p>
         </div>
         <img src="" alt="" class="step__img"> <!-- todo GET A 98%+ FC ON THE 140BPM ONE TO USE AS AN IMAGE -->
       </div>
       <div class="step" id="step-2">
         <h3 class="step__heading">PHASE 2</h3>
         <h4 class="step__sub-heading">Stamina</h4>
         <div class="step__text">
           <p>This phase works the exact same as the phase before but this time your goal is to mainly practice stamina.</p>
           <p>Do the exact same thing as in Phase 1. By now you should play the 170bpm diff. You probably notice a strain somewhere in your arm now because you use specific muscles more than before. This is an important barrier you have to break if you want stamina for deathstreams.</p>
           <p>Keep playing, though! Play through the strain, try to minimize the strain by relaxing your hand. I know this might sound weird but you can actually rebuild stamina while death streaming.</p>
           <p><span class="important">IF IT HURTS STOP IMMEDIATELY!!</span> Strain is not pain!</p>
           <p>While doing push ups you will start to reach your limits and you will strain. This is the strain I'm talking about. Push ups are not supposed to hurt right?</p>
           <p>Do this until you <strong>fc the 180bpm version with 95%+.</strong></p>
         </div>

         <h3 class="step__heading">PHASE 3</h3>
         <h4 class="step__sub-heading">Optional Stamina</h4>
         <div class="step__text">
           <p>If you enjoy this kind of practice you can continue going up to whatever bpm you like.</p>
           <p>Just to show you this method works - this is how far I [khz NOT me, dear god this is impossible] have come with this method:</p>
         </div>
         <img src="" alt="" caption="I've fc'd this over 10 times. If I can, so can you! :) [<- Lies]" class="step__img">

       <div class="step" id="step-4">
         <h3 class="step__heading">PHASE 4</h3>
         <h4 class="step__sub-heading">Speed</h4>
         <div class="step__text">
           <p>You probably noticed that your speed has indirectly increased by the previous stages. Now it's just about playing fast maps and getting used to the speed. Keep in mind single tapping jumps can also help increase raw speed when you are new to a specific bpm.</p>
           <p>Also here the osu!trainer from fun orange comes in handy. Just adjust the speed of a too slow or too fast map to the speed you want. Use this trainer! It's a very good tool for practice. I just recommend keeping the OD (overall difficulty) at something reasonable like 8-10.</p>
